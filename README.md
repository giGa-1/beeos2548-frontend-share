# Mints Launchpad Frontend

A secure and modern frontend for NFT/Token minting operations across multiple blockchain networks. Built with Next.js for optimal performance and user experience.

## Overview

Mints Launchpad provides a seamless minting experience on **Ethereum Mainnet**, **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)**, and other supported networks. Our platform connects user wallets through **private, secure RPC endpoints**, ensuring safe and reliable transactions throughout the minting process.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Support** — Primary support for Ethereum Mainnet and BNB/BSC, with additional networks available
- **Secure RPC Connections** — All wallet connections route through private, secure RPC endpoints
- **Modern UI/UX** — Clean, responsive interface optimized for minting operations
- **Real-Time Updates** — Live transaction status and minting progress

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
